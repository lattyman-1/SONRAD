# SONRAD
Documentation for the installation and setup of the Raspberry Pi environment for the 2021 Villanova SONRAD Capstone Project

Programming done by Benjamin Lattmann

In order to replicate the installation of the Raspberry Pi environment used in our SONRAD project, begin with the instructions in step 1 and proceed from there. 
Once finished with the instructions in step 1, proceed to the next step and continue.

Steps 2 and 2.5 can be completed in either order. They are separated because of my testing and verification procedures during the prototyping process
To get accurate results, construct the prototype with sensors placed similarly to the positioning of our current prototype.

Final report to be uploaded here soon to provide all-in-one access to the whole SONRAD project
