There are 2 Walabot files in this folder, one is a walabot.DEB file and one is walabot.exe file

The .exe is a windows-compatible installer, this will allow you to utilize the tutorial environment to observe basic applications of the sensor with more tangible feedback

The .deb file is the raspberry pi file we will use for installing the API

Instructions:
1. Unpackage the .deb file
	You should be able to double-click on the .deb file once it is downloaded to the pi to open up the package installer
	This will open up and get the first parts of the walabot API prepared for you
	THE WALABOT API WILL NOT BE FUNCTIONAL AT THIS POINT

	if this does not work, type the following command into the terminal (you need to be in the directory you have the .deb file saved to)
		sudo dpkg -i ___.deb

2. navigate to the .tar.gz file
	open up terminal
	we need to get to the folder which was just installed onto the pi
	first, we should get to the home directory
		cd *terminal commands are indented like this*
	then we want to navigate out of the home directory backwards
		cd ..
		cd ..
	yes, do the command twice, you should be in the directory labeled as "pi@raspberrypi:/ $" I believe. you cannot go any further up the ladder
	Now we navigate to the newly installed folder
		cd /usr/share/walabot/python

	Run the API installer:
		python3 -m pip install WalabotAPI-XXX.XXX.XXX.tar.gz
	IF IT SAYS "pip not installed" or something like that:
		sudo apt install python3-pip

	The API should now be successfully installed
	We can check if it installed properly
	Navigate back to the starting folder
		cd
		cd ..
		cd ..
		cd /usr/include
		ls
	*look for the file named WalabotAPI.h*
	if you find the file then it is installed correctly and good to go

We can't forget the SFML API files, so we just have to tell our package manager to grab and install that file
(referenced from https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php)

	type into the terminal:
		sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
	Once installed, we should be good to proceed onto the next step
