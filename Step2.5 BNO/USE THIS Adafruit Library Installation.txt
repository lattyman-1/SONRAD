STEPS USED:
sudo raspi-config
	option 5: interfacing options
	IC2 -> enable it


configuring I2C
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c

sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus
sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools

move the following files into the same directory as the main function:
	imumaths.h
	matrix.h
	RPi_BNO055.h
	RPi_BNO055.cpp
	vector.h
	RPi_Sensor.h
*All of these files should be included in the download from the zipped folder*

Make sure the sensor is plugged in properly, I will attach pictures in the folder illustrating the positions of the pins on the board and where they should plug into

SHOULD BE SET UP AND GOOD TO RUN NOW
if fail then make sure that all steps have been followed, and that the pi is up to date


If the program fails to run, then make sure to run the program as a superuser:
	sudo ./main.out
if you don't the gpio pins are unable to be used, safety of external modifications
