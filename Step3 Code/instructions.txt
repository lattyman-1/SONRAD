In this folder we have 3 files to worry about:
	buildMain.sh
	main.cpp
	main.out

First, copy all files from the BNOAddition directory into the same directory you wish to execute from, I recommend putting them in a folder in the Desktop.
navigate to the directory with the files in them from the terminal
If you put it on the desktop, this is what command you'd use:
	cd Desktop/folderName


Our program is the main.cpp file, we can modify the code either through a normal text editor or through the command
	nano main.cpp
	*in order to save the changes you make, use the command Ctrl+X and save the file as main.cpp*

Before we can run the program, we need to compile and build it
The command for it has been prewritten in our buildMain.sh file, so execute the build file with
	./buildMain.sh

Likely, the program will not be executable right away. If it is not listed as an executable, run the following command
	sudo chmod +x *.sh

Once this command finishes, the program can be run with the command
	./main.out

Exit the program with Ctrl+C

When making changes, repeat the steps starting from "nano main.cpp" and recompile
