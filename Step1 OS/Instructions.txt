I used the tool Win32DiskImager to install the operating system onto the SD card

This is the exact operating system and tool I used, not sure how any other downloads might affect the functionality
(GitHub has a file size limit so the exact version I used is the file named "2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch-full". Any version of raspbian should work)

One the system has been installed, try to follow these instructions:
1. Follow boot instructions to set language, time, password, etc
	-I used password SONRAD (some type of capitalization SONRAD/Sonrad/sonrad)
	-It shouldn't matter which one you use, just as long as you remember it
2. Update the system (type into terminal)
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt full-upgrade
this step will take a long time and requires internet connection, so make sure you're ready for that part

Established a VNC server on the Pi, allowing me to connect virtually to the pi from my laptop and use my trackpad and keyboard
	Purely convenience, it can be a little annoying sometimes so this step is optional
	Here's the link I followed to set it up
	https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/
		WARNING: I have had it where the server does not always boot up on start, and I have to manually turn it on and then restart the pi to have access to it

Pi should be set up and good to go at this point, now we install the sensor libraries
